Welcome to the GitHub repository for my thesis, "The Importance of Random Effects in Variable Selection: A Case Study in Early Childhood Education." 
Below is a guide to navigating this repository.

- simulation.Rmd: code that built and ran my simulation.
- thesis_data_work.Rmd: code that cleans and explores characteristics of the ELS@H data.
- min_lambda.csv: a CSV containing the average min and max regularization parameters used for cross validation of the mixed-effects models.
- simulation_data.Rmd: code that generates plots from the simulation results.
- results folder: CSVs containing the final results from the simulation.
- plots folder: plots of the results from the simulation, generated from simulation_data.Rmd.
